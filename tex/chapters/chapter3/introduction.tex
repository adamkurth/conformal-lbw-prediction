\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:ch3-introduction}
We model birth weight risk with a tree-based, nonparametric approach focusing on the LBW region while still modeling the full spectrum of birth weights. Birth weights are first grouped into quantile-defined categories so the tree can detect subtle shifts in risk across the finer LBW region, providing a more granular view. Because all factors potentially affect birth weight, our goal is to pinpoint combinations of predictors that consistently mark subpopulations with an elevated LBW incidence. 

To avoid "double dipping", or using the same observations to both fit the model and set its prior, we derive LBW quantile cut-points and Dirichlet hyperparameters from the \emph{previous} year's data (2020) and apply them to the unchanged 2021 dataset. Figure~\ref{fig:alphavec}
 shows the resulting prior vector \(\boldsymbol\alpha\). The full model (left) shows expected proportion of observations in the NBW category, and the LBW-only (right) shows a uniform prior due to the 10 LBW deciles. Year-to-year, the birth weight distributions are remarkably stable at the national level, making 2020 a suitable proxy for 2021.

Seven dichotomous maternal-infant predictors—maternal race (\texttt{mrace15}), smoking during pregnancy (\texttt{cig\_0}), marital status (\texttt{dmar}), maternal age (\texttt{mager}), education (\texttt{meduc}), adequacy of prenatal care (\texttt{precare5}), and infant sex (\texttt{sex})— are given to CART, searching recursively for the largest improvement gain. To confirm stability and reliability of the split predictors we will provide a 10,000 bootstrap ensemble and compare the variable selection across the trees. This will be further elaborated on in Sections~\ref{sec:ch3-comparison-depth, ch3:boot-var-selection}

\section{Constructing the Informed Prior}
\label{sec:ch3-prior}

\subsection{Quantile Cut-points \& Informed Prior from 2020 Data}
\label{sec:ch3-cutpoints}
To avoid "double dipping", or using the same observations for both the model fit and setting its prior, we derive the LBW quantile cut-points and Dirichlet hyperparameters from the \emph{previous} year's dataset (2020) and apply them to the unchanged 2021 dataset. All birth weights less than the threshold of 2.5 kg are divided into 10 equal-frequency categories, or deciles, comprising the 10\% quantiles mentioned earlier. The LBW then smoothly transitions from "extremely low" (lowest 10\%) to "moderately low" (highest 10\%), and pool all NBW observations into the eleventh category denoted as \texttt{counts\_above\_2.5kg}. The large NBW group in the full model allows us to see how this dominant category influences tree splits and variable selection. A comparison of LBW-only model omits this last category so that its attention centers around variation \emph{within} the LBW region in Section~\ref{sec:ch3-comparison}.

From the 2020 proportions we construct the Dirichlet prior,  \(\boldsymbol{\alpha} = (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_K)\). Figure~\ref{fig:alphavec} depicts the resulting priors: with the left panel highlighting the strength toward NBW in the full model, whereas the right panel shows the uniform prior among LBW categories in the LBW-only model. The national birth weight distributions vary little year-over-year, the 2020 data serves as an appropriate proxy for 2021.

\end{figure}


\section{DM-CART}
\label{sec:ch3-dm-cart}
\subsection{Custom Objective Function \& Splitting}
\label{sec:ch3-objective-function}
We fitted CART using \texttt{rpart}, in R \parencite{rpart_docs}, replacing the default Gini index with the adjusted marginal log DM likelihood or simply the log likelihood for brevity. Serving as our objective function, its output scores based on the reduction in deviance of a given split, i.e. negative log likelihood output \parencite{rpart_docs, intro_to_rpart}. When splitting, \texttt{rpart} computes the left and right split deviance calculation as in Section~\ref{sec:ch3-splits-in-cart}. For instance, suppose we propose a split on smoking status. The objective function evaluates separating the data into smoking and non-smoking mothers is "distinct" on the count response vector. The improvement is the reduction in deviance, rewarding meaningful distributional shifts, thereby reducing heterogeneity in the node. Thus, distinctness here means the improvement gain from splitting under the predictor in question. Throughout, “risk’’ is used heuristically to describe a subpopulations relative prevalence of LBW outcomes.

\subsection{Tree Results and Insights: Full Model}
\label{sec:ch3-results}
For the full model, Figure~\ref{fig:tree} shows the hierarchical structure of the splits found, and Figure~\ref{fig:full-model-ranked-imp} ranks improvement gain for each split. The full model splits as follows:
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{chapters/chapter3/figures/dm_tree2021.pdf}
  \caption{DM Tree Structure, with normal birth weights.}
  \label{fig:tree}
\end{figure}
The root node contains all of the 2021 birth counts, and naturally the vast majority fall above 2.5 kg. The first, and largest deviance reduction, comes from separating the counts based on race, i.e. Black mothers (\texttt{mrace15}=1) from all other mothers (\texttt{mrace15}=0). This split yields the largest difference in birth weight profile and is shown to be the most informative predictor. This split aligns with documented discrepancies of race, playing a critical role in LBW incidence \parencite{kff_maternal_infant_health_a, pmc1751798}. Among Black mothers, smoking status supplies the next greatest improvement, whereas among non-Black mothers, smoking status is considered \emph{only after} marital status. That is to say, smoking most strongly differentiates outcomes for Black mothers, while partnership status matters more for non-Black mothers. These results show that further splits occur based on racial demographics. Further, analysis demonstrate that the overall highest risk subpopulations are among unmarried Black smokers   where \(\texttt{mrace15}=1,\texttt{cig\_0}=1, \texttt{dmar}=0\). Overall, race, smoking, and marital status jointly account for the bulk of the total improvement, confirming earlier evidence that Black smokers and unmarried non-Black mothers constitute the highest-risk subpopulations among racial demographic splits \parencite{kff_maternal_infant_health_a,pmc1751798, smoking_lbw} and Figure~\ref{fig:tree} and Figure~\ref{fig:full-model-ranked-imp} visualize these results. Further splitting down the branch of Black smokers provides further nuance of the highest-risk subgroups (\(\texttt{mrace15}=1,\texttt{cig\_0}=1, \texttt{dmar}=0\)). This node splits on infant gender, where on average, female infants weight less than male infants \parencite{decreasing_sex_diff_birth_weight2009}. 

Likewise, the lowest-risk subpopulations are where \texttt{mrace15}=0 — recall that smoking status is considered after marital status of the mother. Despite the ordering of ranked, smoking is a direct determinant of LBW incidence \parencite{smoking_lbw}. After socioeconomic and demographic variables are split on, the model emphasizes more biological and genetic predictors, namely gender, prenatal care, and maternal age. The the lowest-risk groups where \(\texttt{mrace15}=0, \texttt{dmar}=1,\texttt{cig\_0}=0\), the final predictor that is considered is age. Moreover, this branch has a depth of 4 while the highest-risk subgroups have a depth of 6 or 7. 

Surprisingly, the only case where education status (\texttt{meduc}) of the mother was used was if the mother was Black, non-smoker, below 33 years old, without adequate prenatal care and female newborn, (i.e. \(\texttt{mrace15} = 1, \texttt{cig\_0} = 0,\texttt{dmar}=0, \texttt{sex}=0, \texttt{mager}=0,\texttt{precare5}=0\)). Given that education has been noted by many \parencite{edu_lbw} to have an effect on socioeconomic conditions, namely earnings, which might not be as strong of a predictor as initially thought.

The full model tree structure provides insights into the direct risk stratification. This approach finds race, smoking status, and marital status as the dominant predictors, ranked as the top three splits in Figure~\ref{fig:full-model-ranked-imp}. The model shifts then toward biological predictors of maternal age, infant gender, and adequacy of prenatal care. Lastly education status is only used in one split, providing the least improvement. 

\subsection{Tree Results and Insights: LBW-Only}
\label{sec:ch3-comparison}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{chapters/chapter3/figures/dm_tree2021_2.pdf}
  \caption{DM Tree Structure, LBW-only model}
  \label{fig:tree_2}
\end{figure}

As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:tree_2}, the restriction to only LBW observations drastically changes the tree's structure. The distributional contrast between NBW and LBW disappears, by the restriction that the LBW-only model brings. Initially, this model has more homogeneity in the data yielding less drastic improvements. Race again dominates the root split, with the second-level splitters being now infant gender in the Black branch and maternal age in the non-Black branch; with smoking status, and marital status never appearing. By every infant already being below 2.5 kg., behavioral and socioeconomic factors that distinguish NBW and LBW, no longer provide useful partitions. Instead, biological factors explain within-LBW heterogeneity. A key takeaway from contrasting the two models is that the LBW-only model suggests Black mothers \textit{continue} to have a higher incidence of LBW newborns. 

Variable importance among the full and LBW-only model are drastically different as well. Figures~\ref{fig:full-model-ranked-imp} and \ref{fig:lbw-model-ranked-imp} order predictors by the sum of total deviance each eliminates across all splits, showing the contrast between predictor usage. The barplots reflects the greedy search of CART, where early splits absorb a large share of heterogeneity and later splits improve the fit only marginally regardless of their actual association with response \parencite{cart_greedy}.   

\subsection{Depth-Controlled Model Comparison}
\label{sec:ch3-comparison-depth}

To investigate how different models select variables as the tree grows, we refit both the full and LBW-only CART models at maximum depths of 2, 3, 4, 5, while explicitly tracking the smoking predictor to discern its roles among other predictors in different modeling contexts. Figures~\ref{fig:trees-comparison-full} and~\ref{fig:trees-comparison-lbw} visualize the trees.

As the depths increase for the full model (Figure~\ref{fig:trees-comparison-full}), the number of terminal nodes expands from 4 at depths 2, to 19 at depth of 5, while the number of predictors rises from 3 to 6. Race, infant gender, and marital status appear in every depth while maternal age and prenatal care are included at depth 4. Moreover,  \texttt{cig\_0} is selected at only at depths 4 and 5, suggesting that once additional socioeconomic and biological variables are available, smoking contributes little deviance reduction with the full spectrum of birth weight outcomes. 

The LBW-restricted trees (Figure~\ref{fig:trees-comparison-lbw}) show a similar growth in complexity from 4 terminal nodes at depth 2, to 15 at depth of 5, and the number of predictors likewise rises from 3 to 6. The number of terminal nodes reflects the more homogeneity of the LBW-only restricted data, consequently considering less splits and returning less leaves compared to the full model. The top splitter among the LBW-only tree was shown to be \emph{marital status} rather than race. The subsequent splits consider race, infant gender, maternal age, and prenatal care. Notably, at depth 4 race was shown to be of significantly less importance compared to the full model. For unmarried mothers, race is considered at the second split on the left branch while on the right branch, for \emph{married} mothers it is considered last and is the terminal node behind infant gender, maternal age, and prenatal care. These results suggest among LBW newborns, marital status plays a critical role in child-development \parencite{marriage_lbw}. Crucially, \texttt{cig\_0} is never selected, indicating that smoking does not differentiate outcomes once infants are already below 2.5 kg. 

It is clear that the predictor hierarchy and prioritization has shifted when the depth parameter is restricted compared to the first fit LBW-only model in Section~\ref{sec:ch3-comparison}. Due to this difference, we will employ a two-tier bootstrap procedure to confirm stability of variable selection and importance. 

\section{Bootstrap Analysis \& Methodology}
\label{sec:ch3:boot}

\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:ch3-boot-intro}
To test whether the splits observed in Section~\ref{sec:ch3-dm-cart} are specific to one realization of the 2021 data, we construct an ensemble of \(B =10,000\) parametric bootstrap trees. Each replicated resampling perturbs the data into two levels that mirror the sampling hierarchy in the DM model. That is to say, we will focus on (1) \emph{between-class} counts and (2) \emph{within-class} counts. These steps will be the stages, or tiers, of the bootstrap procedure. First, we randomize how the total number of births \(T\) is partitioned across the \(N=128\) predictor classes and secondly, given the total class partitions we randomize how those births are allocated among the \(K\) birth weight categories. This will deliver uncertainty estimates that are coherent with our criterion used to fit each tree. Throughout, "row" and "class" are synonymous. 

The goal of the bootstrap procedure is to provide robust and stable probability estimates \(\hat{\pi}_{i,k}\) for each category \(k\). The frequencies in Table~\ref{tab:var_comparison} therefore have a defensible interpretation as the bootstrap probabilities of variable inclusion.

\subsection{Justification of the Two-Tier Bootstrap Procedure}
\label{sec:ch3-justifiaction}
To motivate the multinomial assumption in each tier, consider the consolidated counts data. It is an \emph{aggregated} \(N \times K\) matrix where the cell entries \(n_{i,k}\) are sums of total number of births for class \(i\) and category \(k\). These sums are not \emph{individual} observations. Treating the row vector \(\mathbf{y}_i\) as an i.i.d. "case" would breech the key independence assumption that underpins case-resampling \parencite[slide 47]{case_resampling} \parencite{math10244671}. Moreover, the counts data holds the same structure as a contingency table: conveying the frequencies of any two multivariate vectors, in this case class profiles by birth weight categories \parencite{wiki:contingency}. De-aggregating these frequencies into individual observations before performing bootstrap resampling is required to preserve the within-row dependence, preserving the data structure \parencite{stackexchangeBootstrapResampling}, precisely because each row is a vector of summary statistics \parencite{wiki:summary_statistic}. Further, when sampling any row, the counts vector has fixed proportions of LBW and NBW counts, thereby providing no within-row randomness. The NBW proportion greatly exceeds that of the LBW counts, overshadowing the LBW variability. 

When individual birth records cannot be recovered, the solution is a model-based \emph{parametric} bootstrap that respects both levels of randomness while maintaining faithful to the DM model introduced in Section~\ref{sec:ch3-prior}.

\subsection{Methodology \& Procedure}
\label{sec:ch3-boot-method}
Formally, the two-tier bootstrap resampling procedure is defined here. First, \(T\) defines the grand total counts. \(\mathbf{p} = (p_1, \dots, p_N)\) are the empirical proportions across \(N\) classes. The \emph{bootstrap probability estimates} for class \(i\)  across \(K\) categories are represented as, \(\boldsymbol{\hat{\pi}}_i = (\hat{\pi}_{i,1}, \dots,\hat{\pi}_{i,K})\), these estimates follow the closed-form Equation~\ref{eq:closed-form}. Additionally, the predictor matrix \(\mathbf{X}\) remains fixed; only response counts are resampled.

\[
\begin{aligned}
T            &= \sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{k=1}^{K} n_{ik}              &&\text{(grand total of births)},\\[2pt]
N_i          &= \sum_{k=1}^{K} n_{ik}                            &&\text{(row total for class \(i\))},\\[2pt]
p_i          &= \frac{N_i}{T}, \qquad
\mathbf{p}   =(p_1,\dots,p_N)                                    &&\text{(empirical class shares)},\\[2pt]
\hat{\boldsymbol{\pi}}_i &= (\hat{\pi}_{i,1},\dots,\hat{\pi}_{i,K}) &&\text{(posterior DM mean for class \(i\))}.
\end{aligned}
\]

Recall that the posterior distribution in Equation~\ref{eq:closed-form} for class \(i\) is:
\[
    \boldsymbol{\theta}_i \mid \mathbf{y}_i, \mathbf{x}_i
    \;\sim\;    \operatorname{Dirichlet}\!\bigl(\boldsymbol{\alpha}+\mathbf{y}_i\bigr),
    \tag{\ref{eq:closed-form}}
\]

whose mean estimate,

\[
\hat{\pi}_{i,k}
\;=\;
\mathbb{E}\bigl[\theta_{i,k}\mid\mathbf{y}_i\bigr]
=
\frac{n_{ik}+\alpha_k}{N_i+\alpha_0},
\qquad
\alpha_0=\sum_{k=1}^{K}\alpha_k.
\]
represent the bootstrap probability estimates for \(i,k\). Importantly, these \(K\) estimates are fixed. The posterior distribution infers about \(\theta_{i,k}\) under Equation~\ref{eq:closed-form}, whereas the shrinkage estimate \(\hat{\pi}_{i,k}\) is referred to as fixed under a multinomial distribution in Tier~\ref{para:tier-2}  \parencite{wiki:shrinkage_statistic, duke}.

\paragraph{Tier 1: Between-class counts resampling}
\label{para:tier-1}
First we draw a new vector of class totals from a multinomial distribution, sampling once per class. This tier propagates sampling noise in relative prevalence of the \(N\) predictor profiles.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:stage1}
    \mathbf{n}_i^\ast = (n_1^\ast, \dots, n_N^\ast) \sim \mathrm{Multinomial}(T, \mathbf{p})
    \end{equation}
\paragraph{Tier 2: Within-class counts resampling}
\label{para:tier-2}
Conditioned on the newly drawn total \(n_i^\ast > 0\), resample the \(K\) category counts. 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:stage2}
        \tilde{\mathbf{y}}_i = (\tilde{n}_{i,1}, \dots, \tilde{n}_{i,K}) \sim \mathrm{Multinomial}(n_i^\ast, \hat{\boldsymbol{\pi}}_i)
\end{equation}
Since \(\boldsymbol{\hat{\pi}}_i = (\hat{\pi}_{i,1}, \dots,\hat{\pi}_{i,K})\) is plugged-in and held fixed here, each vector \(\hat{\boldsymbol{\pi}}_i\) under class \(i\) is referred to as the bootstrap probability estimates for \(K\) birth weight categories. Each bootstrap replicate inherits prior information via \(\boldsymbol{\alpha}\), allowing both inter- and intra-class sampling variability to be propagated. The estimates are interpreted naturally as the best guess for the probability of a future birth from class \(i\) to fall into category \(k\). 

After the resampled counts are obtained, \(\tilde{\mathbf Y}^{\ast}=[\tilde n_{i,k}]\) is paired with \(\mathbf{X}\) and fitted with the DM–CART procedure.  From each tree we record the predictor set used in splitting and the root split predictor. Aggregating across \(B\) bootstrap trees yields the frequencies reported in Table~\ref{tab:var_comparison} and the predictor depth comparison in Figures~\ref{fig:var-depth-distributions-full}, ~\ref{fig:var-depth-distributions-lbw}. By tier 1 capturing the uncertainty in class prevalence, and tier 2 capturing uncertainty of the proportions of LBW and NBW within each class, these frequencies can be interpreted as the posterior probabilities of variable selection under the DM hierarchy. 

Note that for each class \(i\), we compute the posterior mean probability estimates \(\hat{\boldsymbol{\pi}}_i\) and hold this vector as fixed when we generate the replicate counts \(\tilde{\mathbf{y}}_i \sim \mathrm{Multinomial}(n^\ast,\hat{\boldsymbol{\pi}}_i)\). Rather than resampling a new \(\boldsymbol{\theta}_i^{(b)} \sim \mathrm{Dirichlet}(\boldsymbol{\alpha} + \mathbf{y}_i)\) inside every bootstrap replicate \(b\), we use the mean estimates and keep the resampling procedure focused on sampling variability of the observed counts data. This approach eliminates the need for a Monte-Carlo procedure and prior information \(\boldsymbol{\alpha}\) from being counted twice.

\subsection{Variable Selection Frequency}
\label{ch3:boot-var-selection}
Table~\ref{tab:var_comparison} distills the frequency of variable selection across the bootstrap ensemble. These are the probability estimates for variable inclusion under each model, highlighting the relative importance under each modeling context. In both the full model and LBW-only model, maternal race consistently emerges as the dominant predictor, appearing as the initial split variable in 100\% of the bootstrap trees. This finding reinforces the conclusion drawn in earlier analyses (see Section~\ref{sec:ch3-comparison-depth}) that racial disparities represent the most prominent signal in the data. Figures~\ref{fig:var-depth-distributions-full} and ~\ref{fig:var-depth-distributions-lbw} show the distribution of each predictor's depth for the full and LBW-only model respectively. 

Beyond race, the variable selection patterns diverge considerably between the two models. In the full model, six of seven variables (infant gender, marital status, prenatal care, smoking status, and race) are selected in every tree (100\%), while education status is selected in approximately 37.94\% of the ensemble. Despite its relatively lower selection frequency, maternal education is deeply positioned in the trees, with an average depth of 5.52 in Figure~\ref{fig:var-depth-distributions-full}, suggesting weak but possibly contextually relevant role in specific subpopulations. In contrast, marital status and smoking status appear much closer to the root at depths 1.69 and 1.52 respectively, indicating stronger global influence across the data. 

In the LBW-only model, the frequency and depth of variable inclusion changed substantially, reflecting a shift in the model's focus. While race and infant gender remain universally selected (100\%), only maternal age maintains high inclusion at 97.41\%, and prenatal care follows at 63.51\%. The remaining variables occur rarely or not at all with marital status (9.15\%), smoking status (1.96\%), and maternal education (0\%). The stark drop in inclusion frequency suggests that given the LBW outcomes, the model reduces its reliance on broader social determinants like education and marital status, and concentrates on variables more directly related to biological and perinatal features such as age and care access. 

This interpretation is further supported by the depth analysis in Figures~\ref{fig:var-depth-distributions-full},~\ref{fig:var-depth-distributions-lbw}. For LBW-only model, maternal race is the top splitter, followed by infant sex (mean depth of 1.12), maternal age (1.15), indicating the early and consistent splits. Prenatal care appears at an intermediate depth (2.02) and less frequently included variables exhibit greater depth, such as marital status and smoking status (2.83 and 2.94, respectively). Notably, maternal education with negligible frequency and high depth (3.00), emphasizing minimal contribution in LBW context. 


\subsection{Ensemble Predictions \& Uncertainty}
\label{sec:ch3-boot-pred}

Following the bootstrap resampling procedure, each replicate yields a vector of predicted probabilities in \(\tilde{\mathbf{Y}}\) for the birth weight categories aggregated across \(B\). For every terminal node subgroup, we take the mean across all replicates to obtain \(\hat{\pi}_{i,k}\), the estimated probability that a birth in class \(i\) falls into birth weight category \(k\). Sampling variability is summarized by empirical 2.5- and 97.5-percentiles of each birth weight category distribution. These 95\% percentile intervals are shown along side point estimates in Tables~\ref{tab:pi_mean_full} and ~\ref{tab:pi_mean_lbw}. Because the interval is simply the middle 95\% of the resampled values, its distribution-free \parencite{percentile-interval}.  For some \(i,k\) combination, the interval is read as 2.5\% (or 97.5\%) of replicates assign smaller (larger) probability than the reported limit \parencite{percentile-interval}. Figures~\ref{fig:high-low-risk-full} and~\ref{fig:high-low-risk-lbw} display the full distribution of two contrasting maternal profiles.  Such profiles are referred to as "high-risk" (class 69) and "low-risk" (class 28) and reflect reasonably assumed to face adverse and favorable birth weight outcomes, respectively.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{High‑risk} (\(i=69\)): unmarried, Black, smoking mothers under 33 with $<$ High-School education, inadequate prenatal care, delivering female infants (\texttt{mrace15} = 1, \texttt{dmar} = 0, \texttt{cig\_0} = 1, \texttt{sex} = 0, \texttt{mager} = 0, \texttt{prenatal} = 0, \texttt{meduc} = 0).
  \item \emph{Low‑risk} (\(i=28\)): married, non‑Black, non‑smoking mothers aged 33+, $\geq$ High-School education, adequate prenatal care, delivering male infants (\texttt{mrace15} = 0, \texttt{dmar} = 1, \texttt{cig\_0} = 0, \texttt{sex} = 1, \texttt{mager} = 1, \texttt{prenatal} = 1, \texttt{meduc} = 1).
\end{itemize}

In the full model, Figure~\ref{fig:high-low-risk-full} and Table~\ref{tab:pi_mean_full}, both profiles have a very high predicted probability of delivering a NBW infant, yet the high-risk profile’s NBW chance (83.6\%) is roughly seven percentage points lower than the low-risk profile (90.9\%). The modest absolute differences corresponds to the pronounced risks across adverse categories. In the most severe LBW category (\(k=1\)) the highest probability is more than double that of the low-risk subgroup (1.9\% vs. 0.8\%). Percentile intervals are extremely narrow (\(\approx \pm 0.002\)) indicating remarkable stability across all bootstrap replicates. 

Likewise, the LBW-only model in Figure~\ref{fig:high-low-risk-lbw} and Table~\ref{tab:pi_mean_lbw}, provides more nuance among the LBW region. The high-risk profile retains a clear disadvantage in the extreme left-tail (12.3\% vs. 8.6\% in \(k=1\)), but the two subgroups converge in the intermediate categories, and in a few moderate LBW categories the low-risk profile even slightly exceeding high-risk subgroup (such as in \(k=8\) of Table~\ref{tab:pi_mean_lbw}). Percentile interval widths still remain narrow (\(\approx \pm 0.008\)), illustrating that these nuanced differences are nonetheless estimated with high stability and precision. 

In identifying determinants of LBW outcomes, this procedure clearly delineates a consistent and statistically reliable separation between high- and low-risk profiles, even when the absolute differences in NBW probabilities appears modest.
